# aichatbot

It's an aichatbot that is being created by using rasa framework.
I have customized it using custom actions that provide the chatbot to provide daily news and currency conversion rates and added the conversations that is providing data to the rasa NLU (Natural Language Understanding) as well including angry,emotional intent with more broader responses to the input of the user.

Just add the api keys to the custom actions that are the python files.
I have used "data.fixer.io" API for the currency rates and "newsapi.org" for the news API.
